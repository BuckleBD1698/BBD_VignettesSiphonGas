This is a very simple and lightweight mod that allows players to siphon fuel from wrecked vehicles into any liquid containers based off the bottle class, eg. jerry cans, glass and plastic water bottles, canteens, etc.

The amount of fuel gained from this is variable, and each wreck can only be siphoned once per server restart.

Eventual TODO in no particular order:
* Server configurable amounts of fuel siphoned
* Add player vehicles as a siphon source
* Ensure all forms of wrecks are covered (99% of them are included, some have weird names)
* Add a 'permanently' siphoned state, ie. can be siphoned only once period, for RP servers or ones that value realism
* Find a way to limit the fuel siphoning solely to the gas cap area. Right now you can do it from anywhere.
